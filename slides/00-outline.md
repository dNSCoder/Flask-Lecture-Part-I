# Flask Fundamentals
## Outline (Lecture) + Workshop

- Target: Year 1 Project
- Focus: clear fundamentals you can apply to any small web system

---

## Learning goals
By the end, students should be able to:

- Explain **request → route → response**
- Create routes with **GET/POST** and **path parameters**
- Render pages with **Jinja2 templates**
- Use **url_for** to generate links
- Organize code with **Blueprints**
- Understand **JSON schema (11A)** and map it to **DB models (11B)**

---

## What we will build later (Workshop)
- A small web system (any domain)
- Includes:
  - pages (list/detail/form)
  - validation + flash messages
  - JSON schema → DB mapping
  - CRUD with DB
  - basic login + protected pages

---

## Materials
- This repo: `slides/`
- Export with **Marp for VS Code** (recommended)
- Keep workshop content separate from lecture deck
